# Mochi User Guide

Mochi is a **desktop app for managing your tasks, optimized for use via a command line interface**, while still having 
benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Mochi can get your productivity tasks done faster 
than traditional GUI apps.

## Quick start

2. Download the latest `mochi.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/releases).
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your Mochi.
4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
